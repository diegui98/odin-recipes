      Fortunes cookies are fun to make at home and fill with your own witty

      party.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 large egg white</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>¼ cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously grease two
        cookie sheets with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write fortunes on strips of paper about 4 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix egg white and vanilla together in a bowl until foamy but not stiff.
        Sift in flour, sugar, and salt; stir until blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop two spoonfuls of batter at least 4 inches apart onto one prepared
        cookie sheet. Tilt the sheet to spread batter into 3-inch-diameter
        circles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are pale in the center and
        golden on the outer 1/2-inch edge, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven. Quickly lift one cookie with a wide spatula and
        place upside down onto a wooden board. Place a fortune on the cookie
        (close to the middle) and fold cookie in half around the paper. Place
        the folded edge over the rim of a measuring cup or coffee mug and pull
        the pointed edges down, one inside the cup and one outside. Place cookie
        into a muffin tin or egg carton to hold its shape as it cools. Repeat to
        form and fill the second cookie.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the first batch is baking in Step 5, repeat Step 4 to form two
        more cookies on the second cookie sheet. When you are shaping the first
        batch of baked cookies in Step 6, bake the second batch. Repeat until
        all cookies are baked and shaped.
      </li>
    </ol>

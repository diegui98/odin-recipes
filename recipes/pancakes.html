    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flour: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk
        pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend
        subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top
        the pancakes with syrup or molasses!
      </li>
      <li>
        Leaveners: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance
        that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter
        to rise to fluffy perfection).
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€”
        the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buttermilk: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes!
        This recipe calls for three whole cups.
      </li>
      <li>
        Milk: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts
        some of the buttermilk's acidity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk
        pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and
        moist.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
        soda, and salt in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted
        butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry
        ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and
        mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended.
        Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is
        bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are
        brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
